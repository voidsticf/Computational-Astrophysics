    "# RT Cooling and Heating\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates how to add cooling and heating by radiation transport (RT) to a prestellar core described by a Bonnor-Ebert sphere. The general idea is that the warm ISM that surrounds the BE-sphere is optically thin to UV-radiation, and can thus be kept at a constant temperature by being exposed to external radiation with that \"radiation temperature\".  The BE-sphere itself is very optically thick in UV-light, and is hence not affected much by the external UV, except in a thin boundary layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the whole BE-sphere is optically transparent to infrared radiation.  As a simple estimate, we can use the fact that the Sun has a surface temperature of about 5000 K (in round numbers), and a radiation field that peaks at about 0.5 micrometer ($\\mu$m), while the cold ISM, which is about 500 times cooler peaks instead at of the order of 300 $\\mu$m.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimates of UV and IR opacitiess\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate the opacity at these very much lower temperatures by using the simple law of _dust extinction_, which states that the absorption by dust is roughly proportional to wavenumber (inverse wavelenght); cf. Fig 1 below."

The visual band has a weighted central wavelength of 540 nm.
