# Computational Astrophysics

This repository contains the assignments' code that were completed as a part of the course Computational Astrophysics at the university of Copenhangen. It focuses on different methods and aspects of computational physics. The code is written in jupyter notebook. The majority of the ipynb files contains theory and coding parts plus some tasks for practice. The solution of the tasks are either in a separate jupyter file named as $\textit{solution.ipynb}$ or it is contained inside the initial jupyter files.

The methods that are related to the files are:

* \textbf{Advection}
  * Derivation
