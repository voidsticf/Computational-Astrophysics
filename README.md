# Computational Astrophysics

This repository contains the assignments' code that were completed as a part of the course Computational Astrophysics at the university of Copenhangen. It focuses on different methods and aspects of computational physics. The code is written in jupyter notebook. The majority of the ipynb files contains theory and coding parts plus some tasks for practice. The solution of the tasks are either in a separate jupyter file named as $\textit{solution.ipynb}$ or it is contained inside the initial jupyter files.

The concepts that are related to the files are:

* $\textbf{Advection}$
  * Numerical solutions: finite differrence / finite volume
  * The integral equations for finite volume
  * The simple advection problem
  * Courant-Friedrich-Leqy condition
  * Upwind  method
* $\textbf{Chemistry}$
  * Microphysics and particularly non-equilibrium chemistry.
* $\textbf{Fluid Mechanics}$
  * Riemann Solvers (HLL and LLF)
  * Simple application of the riemann solvers to the astrophysical problem of blast waves.
* $\textbf{MHD (MagnetoHydroDynamics) }$
  * A physical application for Riemann solvers from the aspect of magnetohydrodynamics.
* $\textbf{Multigrid method}$
  *  A description of the multigrid method is presented and particularly two different strategies V-cycle and W-cycle in the perspective of self-gravity collapse problem
 * $\textbf{Particles}$
  * Different particle systems
  * Point particles and few-body systems
  * Time integration methods and symplectic integrators
 * $\textbf{Radiation}$
  * Main focus on the radiation problem
